Overview
In this project, I performed a comprehensive analysis of stock market data from multiple companies to understand their trends, volatility, and overall market behavior. The primary objective was to analyze historical stock price data, predict future stock prices, and evaluate the risk associated with each company's stock through various visualizations and predictive modeling.

Key Insights and Visualizations
1. Closing Prices Over Time
One of the first visualizations I generated was a line plot of the closing prices for all companies over time. This allowed me to identify trends and patterns in stock performance, including:

Long-term upward or downward movements in stock prices.
Points of volatility or significant change, possibly due to external events.
Comparative performance between different companies over time.
Insight: This plot provided a clear understanding of how the stock prices of different companies evolved and allowed for easy comparison of market behavior across companies.

2. Daily Returns Distribution
By calculating the daily returns (percentage change in closing prices), I was able to visualize the distribution of returns for all companies. This provided insight into the volatility and risk associated with each stock.

Insight:

The distribution of returns helped me identify companies with higher volatility (wider distributions), indicating higher risk.
Companies with more tightly clustered returns were identified as less volatile and potentially more stable.
3. Volatility (Standard Deviation of Returns) Across Companies
To further quantify risk, I calculated the standard deviation of returns for each company, which measures how much the daily returns vary from the average return.

Insight:

Stocks with higher volatility may offer higher potential returns, but at greater risk.
This plot allowed for a quick comparison of which companies were more stable versus those that exhibited higher risk.
Predictive Modeling: ARIMA Time Series Forecasting
The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model was used to predict future stock prices based on historical closing prices. After fitting the model and making predictions, the following results were obtained:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): The MSE between the predicted and actual values provided a quantitative measure of the model's accuracy. A lower MSE indicated that the ARIMA model was able to make reasonable predictions of future stock prices.
Actual vs. Predicted Plot: By comparing the actual closing prices with the predicted values, I was able to visually assess the performance of the ARIMA model.
Insight: The ARIMA model performed well in forecasting short-term stock prices, particularly for companies with more stable historical trends. However, for highly volatile stocks, the predictions tended to deviate more significantly from the actual prices, highlighting the inherent difficulty in forecasting stocks with unpredictable behavior.

Achievements
Throughout this project, I accomplished the following:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Successfully handled missing and non-numeric data to ensure accurate analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generated meaningful visualizations that provided valuable insights into stock performance, daily returns, and volatility.
Time Series Analysis: Developed a predictive ARIMA model that helped forecast future stock prices based on historical data.
Risk Evaluation: Quantified the risk associated with each company's stock using volatility and daily returns.
Visualization of Insights: Combined key visualizations into a single image file, offering a comprehensive view of stock performance and risks.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrated the power of data analysis in understanding stock market behavior and predicting future stock prices. By combining various techniques—such as time series analysis, volatility analysis, and data visualization—I was able to extract meaningful insights and provide forecasts that can aid in decision-making.

While the ARIMA model provided useful predictions for some stocks, the inherent unpredictability of the market—especially for highly volatile stocks—means that no model can guarantee perfect accuracy. Further enhancements, such as incorporating external factors or advanced machine learning models, could improve prediction accuracy in future work.

This project successfully achieved its objectives of analyzing historical stock data, visualizing key insights, and making predictions about future stock prices.
